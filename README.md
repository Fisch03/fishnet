# fishnet
born from my growing hate for most modern web frameworks (and the modern web in general), fishnet is my take on combining old with new: 
a highly performant component based web framework for building quick and open (both for you and the end user) websites.
server side page renders on a reasonably sized page (aka [my personal website](https://github.com/Fisch03/sakanaa.moe)) usually take less than 100Î¼s!

you should use fishnet if you want:
- 0% hydration, resumability, client side routing, virtual doms - 100% pure html, css and js *you wrote* beamed straight from server to client, mostly limited by whatever speed your network is capable of :)
- first-class support for [htmx](https://htmx.org/) in the form of easily defined per-component api endpoints
- compile time checked, type-safe html (thanks to [maud](https://maud.lambda.xyz/)) and css

you probably **shouldn't** use fishnet if:
- you are building anything bigger than a personal website or side project
- you want a highly dynamic page
- you aren't fine with using a immature library developed by an idiot that may or may not be maintained in the future

## using fishnet
don't. at least for now. it's still undergoing heavy development in parallel to [my website](https://github.com/Fisch03/sakanaa.moe). 
i'm glad that you're apparently interested enough to have read this far and would be happy to see you try it out once its ready!

if you want to play around with the codebase nonetheless, add it to your `Cargo.toml` using
```toml
fishnet = { git = "https://github.com/Fisch03/fishnet.git" }
```
docs are available under https://fisch03.xyz/fishnet/. have fun!
